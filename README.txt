For the implementation of the valueIterationAgent. By using the Q value formula to compute the Q value for each action in each state, i was able to store the value in the counter and able to choose the proper action that has the best utility. As  for the q learning agent, the idea is similar but it learns as it goes so for certain actions it chooses randomly epsilon percent of times. 

I spent about 8 hours on this assignment.
